# ML-PCA-Class-Kfold

Understanding key concepts like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), classification evaluation metrics, and K-fold cross-validation is essential for effective machine learning. PCA helps in reducing dimensionality, simplifying models, and enhancing performance, particularly with high-dimensional data. Classification evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are crucial for assessing and comparing model performance, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets. K-fold cross-validation ensures that a model generalizes well to new data by providing a robust estimate of its performance through repeated training and testing on different subsets of the data.
